            Because we all have the capacity to do justice and show mercy; to treat others with dignity and respect; and to rise above what divides us and come together to meet those challenges we can't meet alone. This is where we are right now. Because we reject the same thing that people of all faiths reject: the killing of innocent men, women, and children. America will not turn our backs on the legitimate Palestinian aspiration for dignity, opportunity, and a state of their own. I know that for many, the face of globalization is contradictory.

I do not believe that women must make the same choices as men in order to be equal, and I respect those women who choose to live their lives in traditional roles. There is so much fear, so much mistrust.
